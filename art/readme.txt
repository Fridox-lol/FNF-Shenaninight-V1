FNF THE SHENANINIGHT

Hey there, Lori speaking!
Thanks a BUNCH for downloading the Shenani-Night!
I know you could be impatient to play it...
However we ask you to read this as doing it is a good thing.
Here are some..."rules" we want you to follow to keep things all nice.
1: R34s of the original characters in this mod (like the shenanigoonies) are NOT OKAY, since most of them are minors. If you do (ew) keep it for yourself, don't post it ANYWHERE. Show some public decency, ya goofs.
2: Do NOT claim that the mod, assets, or any songs are yours. Some exceptions can be said for scripts I used in this mod AS LONG as proper credit is given! For songs, you are allowed to make remixes, use them as BG music, speedpaints etc. (If you post them on YT, mention me in the description! I wanna see what you create!)


AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!

3: DO NOT HARASS JOHN!!! Despite him leaving the Shenanigoonies (due to reasons explained in TheTruth.txt folder in mods/images/FORGOTTENSTUFF/HeWhoShallNotBeNamed), you are NOT allowed to harass him for his choices. SERIOUSLY. DON'T. Despite I hate what he's done to us, he doesn't deserve it. Be a decent person and do not spread hate and toxicity over the already toxic internet.

WARNINGS
There's more things to notice.
This mod contains FLASHING LIGHTS AND MOVING STUFF! NOT RECOMMENDED PLAYING IF YOU SUFFER FROM EPILESY OR JUST DON'T LIKE MOVING STUFF!

This mod may contain visual imagery that may be uncomfortable for some players (probably blood), but since probably all the people who will play this mod aren't toddlers, y'all are surely okay with blood.
FNF is not for kids, go outside.


SAVE FILES?
Week 3 has a save file mechanic due to Encrypted having a cutscene mid-song that COULD crash, so I used the save week script by Cappes to make sure you don't get mad. Just press space at the start of Puffball! If the song doesn't start right away, it means you can input the spacebar to skip the week to Encrypted.

WHAT THE FUNK IS THIS?
To read more about the lore/context, I really suggest you to go back to the download page and look at the description as I wrote the basic shit that you should know of, EVEN IF THE MOD WILL HAVE CUTSCENES THAT EXPLAIN IT, IT TOOK ME TOO MUCH TO MAKE THEM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
Or just play the stupid mod and figure it out yourself, Matpat.

SPECIAL THANKS (but the not ingame version)
Thanks to everyone who supported this project 'till the end of development.

Out of all the people who supported the development, I shall thank:
-Buateds, for giving me moral support and helping me with some stuff. Your songs and drawings are FIRE!!!
-Sogamer2, despite some of the fights we had, I'm glad you supported the mod :D
-Rede, your emotional support's incredibly effective! Stop spamming fire emojis on my songsAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
-Ollie, I'm glad you supported my silly mod. Thank goodness I didn't have to use my screwdriver to convince you. :)
-Megann, your drawings and kind words helped me in my darkest moments. Thanks for loving this mod! Luv u :3
-The Shenanigoonies. Y'all are the reason this mod exists. I love y'all and I hope you do enjoy this adventure that I made with tons of effort. I also lost hours of sleep working on this.

it was a BLAST to work on this mod and I'm SUPER proud of the final result: A fine-looking, BANGER and polished (i guess) mod.
And that's all, SO LET'S DIVE IN THE SHENANI NIGHT!

ENJOY!!!

-The ShenaniCrew
